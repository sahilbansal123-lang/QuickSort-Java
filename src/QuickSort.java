//    QuickSort: Quick sort is another popular sorting algorithm that also uses the divide-and-conquer approach to sort
//               list of elements. The basic idea behind quick sort is to choose a pivot element from the list, partition
//               the list into two sub-lists such that elements smaller than the pivot are on the left, and elements
//               greater than the pivot are on the right, and then recursively apply quick sort to each sub-list.

//               Here are the steps involved in the quick sort algorithm:

//                    1. Choose a pivot element from the input list. The pivot can be any element, but commonly the first
//                       or last element of the list is chosen.
//                    2. Partition the list into two sub-lists: elements smaller than the pivot are on the left, and elements
//                       greater than the pivot are on the right.
//                    3. Recursively apply quick sort to each sub-list, until they are sorted.
//                    4. Concatenate the sorted left sub-list, the pivot, and the sorted right sub-list to produce a
//                       fully sorted list.
